# Instructions to run AMUND_ICE

## Downloads
Download MITgcm 
- Create directory ./MITgcm and cd into it then
>  git clone git@github.com:dngoldberg/MITgcm.git 

Download the Singularity container for OpenAd:
- Create directory ./Singularity and cd into it then
>  singularity pull library://jahn/default/openad:latest

 Download/copy files for AmundIce:
> git clone git@github.com:eCSE-MITgcm-ARCHER2/eCSE-archer2-AmundIce.git
   The directories 
-    input_ecse
-    code_ecse
-    scripts_ecse
   will be cloned into a local repository.

## Environment
 - Set the environment variables in scripts_ecse/case_setup, a script used to have a unique place to set your environment for making and for runs.
 - Set the environment variable MITGCM_ROOTDIR to the location of your MITgcm source (so, e.g. tools is s subdirectory there).
 - update "make_archer.sh" with locations of OpenAD singularity image and PETSc installation

## SET UP A CASE
To give flexibility to change either the scripts/code used by all your runs (in ecse...) or just the  files for a  specific case...
Create a "case" directory: it will have subdirectories
- ./scripts  A copy of scripts_ecse edited for this case
- ./build_ad where the executable is built
- ./run_ad  where the run is made.
- ./code A copy of the code used.
e.g. when running a test with 90 cores and O3 optimisation: 

> cd scripts_ecse

> ./create_amundice_case  /work/yourPath/cases/90/O3 

The build and run directories are generated by scripts below.
One of the benefits of arranging it like this is that there remains a record of exactly what was used in a case, so subsequent changes to the ecse-scripts directory don't affect the record of what a case actually used.

## BUILD THE EXECUTABLE.

- change to the case's scripts directory.
- run the "make_archer.sh" script. (The build should require ~15 minutes)


## SUBMIT THE EXECUTABLE.

-  run the script "submit_ad.sh". (The script should run on 90 cpus on a single node, and should last approx runtime 4-5 hours)

# MAKING CHANGES
## THE NUMBER OF CPUs

To modify the cpu count, 2 changes must be made:
- the SLURM header of scripts/run.slurm should be changed to reflect nodes and cpus per node (currently 1 and 90, resp)
- sNx (sNy) and nPx (nPy) of code/SIZE.h should be modified, such that the products sNx*nPx and sNy*nPy remain constant. Executable must be rebuilt.

## TURN OFF USE OF PETSC
After creating the run directory, data.streamice set "streamice_use_petsc = .false.". No recompilation is necessary.

## SET A DIFFERENT RUN TIME

 currently the model does a 20-year simulation with 240 1-month time steps. To modify this change "nTimeSteps" within file 'data'. No recompilation is necessary.
